  Easily place, connect, and configure components on a virtual breadboard or PCB layout with real-time simulation feedback.

* **Advanced Microcontroller Simulation:**
  Supports multiple microcontrollers with accurate pin-level logic, timing, and communication protocols. Program components using JavaScript or embedded scripting.

* **Robotics Components:**
  Includes motors, servos, sensors, LEDs, and other peripheral devices. Pin-specific behaviors and interactions are accurately modeled.

* **Realistic Electrical Simulation:**
  Components behave according to real-world physics, including voltage, current, and resistance interactions. Logical errors and conflicts are detected instantly.

* **Project Sharing and Collaboration:**
  Save and share projects seamlessly. Collaborate in real time with classmates or colleagues.

* **User-Friendly Interface:**
  Clean, modern, and responsive UI inspired by professional platforms. Dark, techy theme with neon accents for visual clarity.

* **Modular Architecture:**
  Fully modular codebase with reusable components for future expansion, including robotics, sensors, and AI-integrated circuits.

## Why Pico Lab?

 We designed Pico Lab to solve common frustrations found in existing platforms:

* Laggy simulations with limited scalability.
* Poor accuracy in component behavior.
* Complicated UI that discourages experimentation.
* Lack of integrated programming and robotics support.

Pico Lab addresses these by combining a robust simulation engine, a modular architecture, and a user-first interface design.
